# SnackChain Big Data Project

This project was completed as part of a Big Data Analytics course using Databricks and Spark.
This project analyzes a large dataset from a fictional snack retailer "SnackChain", focusing on identifying trends in sales across stores, understanding customer preferences, and applying machine learning to predict future demand.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Internal dataset (Excel format)
- **Sheets**:
  - `stores`: Store metadata
  - `products`: Product information
  - `transactions`: Transaction records (main analysis target)
  - `glossary`: Definitions of data columns

## Goals

- Clean and preprocess the dataset using PySpark
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Use SparkSQL for business intelligence queries
- Train multiple SparkML models to predict sales patterns
- Evaluate and compare models
- Demonstrate full data pipeline in Databricks

## Technologies

- Databricks Community Edition
- Apache Spark (SparkSQL, SparkML)
- PySpark
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Structure

- `notebook/`: Contains main Jupyter Notebook with all code
- `data/`: Raw dataset files
- `images/`: Data flow diagrams and visualizations
- `README.md`: This file
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages used
